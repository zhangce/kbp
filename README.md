KBP
====

In this document we will build an application for the slot filling (relation extraction) task of the 
[TAC KBP competition](http://www.nist.gov/tac/2014/KBP/). This example uses a sample of the data for the 2010 task. Note that the data provided in this example application is only 0.2% of the original corpus so the recall of the results (and thus the F1 score) will be low. However, using 100% of the 2010 corpus, this example system achieves a winning score of ___ on the KBP task.

## Application overview

This tutorial will walk you through building a full DeepDive application that extracts the TAC KBP relationships between mentions of entities in raw text. We use news articles and blogs as our input data and want to extract all pairs of entities that participate in the KBP relations (e.g. *Barack Obama* and *Michelle Obama* for the `spouse` relation).

The application is an extension of the [mention-level extraction system](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/walkthrough-mention.html). The application performs the following high-level steps:

1. Load data from provided database dump
2. Extract entity mentions from sentences
3. Extract lexical and syntactic features for relation mentions (entity mentions pairs in the same sentence)
4. Extract candidates for coreferent mentions
5. Extract features for entity linking (linking Freebase entities to mentions in text)
6. Generate positive and negative training examples for relation mentions
7. Extract the relation mentions
8. Generate a factor graph using inference rules
9. Perform inference and learning
10. Generate results

For simplicity, we will start by loading a database dump that contains all of the tables necessary to run the system.

Let us now go through the steps to get the example KBP system up and running.

### Overview of inference rules

The inference rule (`relation_mention_lr`) simply uses the features extracted from the relation mentions to learn the expectation of a given relation mention being correct.

<a id="installing" href="#"> </a>

## Installing DeepDive

This tutorial assumes a working installation of DeepDive.
Please go through the
[example application walkthrough](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/walkthrough.html) before proceeding.

After following the walkthrough, your deepdive directory should contain a folder called "app", which should contain a folder called "spouse".

<a id="setting_up" href="#"> </a>

## Setting Up KBP Application

<a id="cloning" href="#"> </a>

### Cloning the repository

Navigate to the folder "app" (same folder as you use in the walkthrough), 
clone this repository, and switch to the correct branch.

    >> git clone https://github.com/zhangce/kbp.git
    >> cd kbp
    >> git checkout mike-tsv-extractors

To validate this step, you should see:

    >> git branch
      master
      mike-ce-stringlib
      mike-readme
    * mike-tsv-extractors
    >> ls
    README.md           data            env_db.sh       run-evaluate.sh     schema.sql          udf
    application.conf    env.sh          evaluation      run.sh              setup_database.sh          		
	
From now on we will be working in the kbp directory.

<a id="connecting" href="#"> </a>

### Connecting to the database

Change the database settings in the file `env_db.sh`, whose original contents is:

    #! /bin/bash
    export DBNAME=deepdive_kbp_mikhail
    export PGHOST=localhost
    export PGPORT=5432

Change this file to point to your database.

To validate this step, you should be able to connect to the database by running the following commands:
    
    >> source env_db.sh
    >> psql -h $PGHOST -p $PGPORT -l
                                            List of databases
              Name           |  Owner   | Encoding | Collate | Ctype |   Access privileges   
    -------------------------+----------+----------+---------+-------+-----------------------
     template0               | postgres | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/postgres          +
    ...
    
<a id="loading" href="#"> </a>

### Loading initial data

The initial database dump contains the following tables:
- `sentence`: contains processed sentence data by an [NLP extractor](walkthrough-extras.html#nlp_extractor). This table contains tokenized words, lemmatized words, POS tags, NER tags, dependency paths for each sentence. The table contains 70805 sentences, which is 0.2% of the full corpus for 2010.
- `kb`: Contains tuples of the form (entity1, relation, entity2); this is the knowledge base used for distant supervision.
- `entities`: A set of entities from Freebase.
- `fbalias`: Freebase aliases for entities (a single entity can have several aliases).
- `relation_types`: The typed relations we care to extract.
- `incompatible_relations`: Contains tuples of the form (relation1, relation2) where relation2 is incompatible with relation1. This is used to generate negative examples (given (e1, relation1, e2), (e1, relation2, e2) will be a negative example).
- `ea`: Contains the ground truth for the evaluation; to be used for error analysis.

There are 3 additional tables that the system will need to create, to be used by the extractors. The tables are:
- `mentions` (populated by `ext_mention`)
- `relation_mentions` (populated by `ext_relation_mention_positive`, `ext_relation_mention_negative`, and `ext_relation_mention`)
- `relation_mention_features` (populated by `ext_relation_mention_feature`)

The first 7 tables are included in the database dump, and the second 3 tables are created in `schema.sql`. The script `setup_database.sh` will load all 10 tables into the database.

Load the initial database:

    >> sh setup_database.sh

You may see some errors, but don't worry, they can be ignored. Validate that this step succeeded as follows:

    >> source env_db.sh

    >> psql -h $PGHOST -p $PGPORT $DBNAME -c "\d"

## Writing extractors

The extractors are created in `application.conf`. Several extractors in this example are [TSV extractors](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/extractors.html#tsv_extractor), and the UDFs for them are contained in `APP_HOME/udf`. However, the majority are [SQL extractors](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/extractors.html#sql_extractor) that do not have UDFs.

As stated in the [overview](#overview), the extractors perform the following high-level tasks:

- Extract entity mentions from sentences
- Extract lexical and syntactic features for relation mentions (entity mentions pairs in the same sentence)
- Extract candidates for coreferent mentions
- Extract features for entity linking (linking Freebase entities to mentions in text)
- Generate positive and negative training examples for relation mentions
- Extract the relation mentions

We will walk through each of the extractors in more detail below.


### Cleanup

The `ext_cleanup` extractor cleans up the tables that will be populated by the extractors. This extractor is defined in `application.conf` using the following code:

```bash
ext_cleanup {
  sql: """
    DELETE FROM relation_mentions;
    DELETE FROM relation_mention_features;
    DELETE FROM mentions;
  """
  style: "sql_extractor"
}
```

### Entity mentions

We first need to identify the entity mentions in the text. Given a set of sentences, the entity mention extractor will populate the `mentions` table using NER tags from the `sentence` table, generated by the NLP toolkit.

A mention can consist of multiple words (e.g. Barack Obama); the way we can identify these is if all of these words have the same NER tag.

This extractor goes through all the words in the sentence and outputs as a mention the consecutive words that have the same NER tag.

This extractor is defined in `application.conf` using the following code:

```bash
ext_mention {
  input : """
    SELECT doc_id,
           sentence_id,
           my_array_to_string(words, '~^~', 'NULL') AS words,
           my_array_to_string(ner, '~^~', 'NULL') AS ner,
           my_array_to_string(character_offset_begin, '~^~', 'NULL') AS character_offset_begin,
           my_array_to_string(character_offset_end, '~^~', 'NULL') AS character_offset_end
    FROM sentence
  """
  output_relation: "mentions"
  udf: ${APP_HOME}"/udf/ext_mention.py"
  style: "tsv_extractor"
  dependencies : ["ext_cleanup"]
}
```

The input query simply selects the appropriate columns from the sentence table and converts the columns that contain arrays to strings (since TSV extractors take in strings as input).

**Input:** sentences along with NER tags. Specically, each line in the input to this extractor UDF is a row in the `sentence` table in TSV format, e.g.:

    TODO

**Output:** rows in `mentions` table, e.g.:

    TODO

The script `$APP_HOME/udf/ext_mention.py` is the UDF for this extractor, which can be written as follows:

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python

"""

### Relation mention feature: word sequence

Once we have identified the entity mentions in text, we can extract features from all mention pairs in the same sentence (these mentions pairs are referred to as relation mentions). This extractor will extract the *word sequence* feature for a relation mention: the exact sequence of words that occurs between the two mentions.

This extractor is defined in `application.conf` using the following code:

```bash
ext_relation_mention_feature_wordseq {
  input: """
    SELECT s.doc_id AS doc_id,
           s.sentence_id AS sentence_id,

### Relation mention feature: dependency path

TODO


<a id="debugging_extractors" href="#"> </a>

## Debugging extractors

It is useful to debug each extractor individually without running the DeepDive system every time. To make this easier, a general debug extractor is provided in `udf/util/dummy_extractor.py`. This extractor produces a file from the SQL input query to allow the user to directly pipe that file into the desired extractor. Run the dummy extractor once to produce the sample file, and then debug the extractor by looking at the output without running the DeepDive pipeline.

For example, consider a scenario where we want to debug the entity mention extractor, `ext_mention`. We can first run `ext_mention_debug` to produce a sample TSV file, `udf/sample_data/ext_mention_sample_data.tsv`.

Refer to [DeepDive's pipeline functionality](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/pipelines.html) to see how to run the system with only a particular extractor. We can specify something like the following in `application.conf`:

    pipeline.run: "debug_mention_ext"
    pipeline.pipelines.debug_mention_ext: ["ext_mention_debug"]

After running run.sh, this file can then be piped into the extractor we wish to debug, `udf/ext_mention.py`:

    >> cat $APP_HOME/udf/sample_data/ext_mention_sample_data.tsv | python $APP_HOME/udf/ext_mention.py

This process allows for interactive debugging of the extractors.

Note that if you change the inut SQL query to an extractor, you will also need to change it in the debug version of that extractor.

The code for `ext_mention_debug` is commented out in `application.conf`; similar code is also provided for `ext_relation_mention_feature_wordseq` and `ext_relation_mention_feature_deppath`.




You are now ready to run the KBP application.

## Evaluating the results

The KBP application contains a scorer for the TAC KBP slot filling task. The example system will not achieve a high score on the task because our sample of 70805 sentences is only 0.2% of the full corpus.

To get the score, type in:

    >> sh run-evaluate.sh

In this log, the precision is 62.5 (human agreement rate is around 70), and recall is low
since our sample is 0.2% of the full corpus.

For the ease of error analysis, we also include a relational-form of the ground truth. To
see the ground truth, type in:

    >> source env_db.sh 
    >> psql -h $PGHOST -p $PGPORT $DBNAME -c "SELECT * FROM ea limit 10;"
